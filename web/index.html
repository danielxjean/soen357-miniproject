                <p>In today’s society, digital devices are within reach. 
                    Whether we like it or not, electronic devices have become a major part of our lives. 
                    Whether it be to order food, chat with a friend or watch a movie, the average amount of screen time is 11 hours per day in North America [1]. 
                    The number is only getting worst with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic which forced many of us to move our daily activities to the digital screens. 
                    In fact, it is estimated that around 42% of people have shifted to working from home and many students are also being taught through a screen. [2] 
                    Our devices allow us to communicate with loved ones, shop, learn, transfer money, order food, book a trip and many other useful features. Super apps have made it even simpler for us by combining many services in one single application. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p> 
                    While our devices have proven to be very useful, during the Covid-19 pandemic, 
                    by helping us feel less alone through communication with friends and family or by keeping us entertained, 
                    it is important to understand that an excess usage of these devices can interfere with our physical and mental health.

            <p>Super apps have gained popularity over the last decade as they offer an all-in-one solution to many user needs. 
                However, the most popular super apps are mainly used in Asia, and they do not consider the impact of extended usage on their user's well-being.
                Furthermore, there exists many applications which allow users to avoid excess screen time, but these apps often lack features and require a paid subscription.

            <p>After researching other super apps and understanding how they work and what they offer, we were able to

                    sections about their goals and frustrations regarding their experience with super apps. General information

                        and nature lead us to choose this color palette because of its calming effect and its association to
                        nature. We thought that this can help our users connect to the outside world around them during this
                        pandemic. According to our study, there was a great need for connection, and we think that the 
                        green color may do just that, as well as give a calm and soothing warmth.

                <p>To sum it all up, it was interesting to conduct research on the health habits and needs of a small portion of the population amidst this pandemic.
                    One thing is certain, the pandemic has had a great effect on people's mental health. Many of our participants (most of which are students) have been feeling
                    anxious, stressed, and even depressed. The most staggering statistic was that many of our participants mentioned having a lack of motivation.
                    The data speaks for itself that many individuals seek to connect with others and thus, have been spending a considerable portion of time in front of a screen.
                    Some of these persons have noticed the changes in their mental health and sleep deprivation is vastly linked to their screen time.

                <p>HomeoStasis can be beneficial in providing healthy screen habits for its users. Through the research of the users needs,
                    we have decided to focus on features that allow its users to have a balance to encourage a healthier lifestyle. From drinking water,
                    to taking breaks and exercising, to sleeping and meditating, and even doing their groceries, we hope to pursue just that. We hope to really
                    have an impactful change for our users, that they may feel healthier and be healthier spiritually, physically, and mentally.
