                <p>In today’s society, digital devices are at arms reach. 
                    Whether we like it or not, electronic devices have become a major part of our lives. 
                    Whether it be to order food, chat with a friend or watch a movie, 
                    the average amount of screen time is 11 hours per day in North America. 
                    The number is only getting worse with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic which forced many of us to move our daily activities to the digital screens. 
                    In fact, it is estimated that around 42% of people have shifted to working from home and many students are also being taught through a screen. While these devices can help us feel less alone by communicating with friends and family or keep us entertained, it is important to understand how these devices can interfere with our physical and mental health.

                <span class="subtitle">Survey</span>
                <p>We created a survey to better understand the needs of our users. Amidst this pandemic, there are multiple ways
                    to encourage healthier habits, but collecting data is necessary to uncover what these issues are that the superapp
                    is seeking to improve. We used Google Forms to distribute our survey that was in compliance with the professor's 
                    guidelines for collecting data. The survey can be found <a href="../docs/SOEN357 Survey - Google Forms.pdf">here</a> and the data could be found in this <a href="../docs/SOEN357 Survey.csv">sheet</a>.
                </p>
                <p>The collected data was then placed into the following bar and pie charts for a more comprehensive understanding of said data.

            <p>After researching other super apps and understanding how they work and what they offer, we were able to
                come up with features that are not all present in the current super apps. In order to
                understand our users, we gave out a questionnaire to gather data. It helped us to write the analysis section,
                understand how the users feel vis-à-vis screen time and what kind of well-being features they would like
                to have on their phone.</p>

                <p>We created user personas of people who would use our app based on the data we received in the survey.
                    There are four different characters with different demographics. The user personas describe the personal
                    information of each person, as well as a general biography of their life. There are different
                    sections about their goals and frustrations towards their experience with super apps. General information
                    such as their screen habits and personality are also displayed.

                    This journey map describes the experience of Jalen Robinson, one of our user persona.
                    It help us understand the good and bad moments he will encounter when opening the app up until
                    he closes it. The sections illustrate what Jalen think, does and thinks throughout every step he
                    takes on the application.

                        and nature lead us to choose this color palette because of its calming effect and its association to
                        nature. We thought that this can help our users connect to the outside world around them during this
                        pandemic. According to our study, there was a great about of need for connection, and we think that the 
                        green color may do just that, as well as give a calm and soothing warmth.

                <p>To sum it all up, it was interesting to conduct research on the health habits and needs of a small portion of the population amidst this pandemic.
                    One thing is certain, the pandemic has had a great effect on people's mental health. Many of our participants (most of which are students) have been feeling
                    anxious, stressed, and even depressed. The most staggering statistic was that many of our participants mentioned having a lack of motivation.
                    The data speaks for itself that many individuals seek to connect with others and thus, have been spending a considerable portion of time in front of a screen.
                    Some of these persons have noticed the changes in their mental health and sleep deprivation is vastly linked to their screen time.
                </p>
                <p>HomeoStasis can be beneficial in providing healthy screen habits for its users. Through the research of the users needs,
                    we have decided to focus on features that allow its users to have a balance to encourage a healthier lifestyle. From drinking water,
                    to taking breaks and exercising, to sleeping and meditating, and even doing their groceries, we hope to pursue just that. We hope to really
                    have an impactful change for our users, that they may feel healtier and be healthier spiritually, physically, and mentally.
